#Advice for contributing


The recommended Spice software for circuits is LTSpice

The recommended CAD software for mechanical design is Fusion 360

For compilers you will need to have arduino IDE installed for ESP32 projects and for everything else VS and VS-code should be fine but you can also use any other compiler that works 

*as a footnote these are all recommendations however you can contribute using any software you feel like as long as file types match
